# BlueGate
PoC for the Remote Desktop Gateway vulnerability - CVE-2020-0609 &amp; CVE-2020-0610. Thanks to [ollypwn](https://twitter.com/ollypwn) for pointing out my silly mistake!

## Setup
I'm using a patched version of `pydtls` as the original repository wouldn't build properly.
```
cd pydtls
sudo python setup.py install
```

## Denial of Service
A PoC for the DoS attack can be found in [dos.py](https://github.com/ioncodes/BlueGate/blob/master/dos.py). This essentially crashes the Remote Desktop Gateway service. The initial PoC can be found in the commits or [here](https://github.com/ioncodes/BlueGate/blob/91ad3951c0db0944a5f8ade8c4af1ae6bd69836e/dos.py).

### Usage
```
python dos.py 192.168.8.133 3391
```

### Result
Before:
![before](images/before_dos.png?raw=true)

After:
![after](images/after_dos.png?raw=true)


## Scanner
A scanner that is able to determin whether the target is vulnerable or not. The script can be found in [check.py](https://github.com/ioncodes/BlueGate/blob/master/check.py). The timeout is set to 3 seconds by default but can be adjusted in the source code.

### Usage
```
python check.py 192.168.8.134 3391
```

### Result
It says either `Vulnerable!` or `Not vulnerable!`.
